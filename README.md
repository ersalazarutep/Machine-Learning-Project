Target Variable Definition: The code defines a binary target variable (Above Median Salary) where the value is 1 if the salary is above the median and 0 otherwise. This makes it a binary classification problem, which is suitable for logistic regression.
Model Selection: The code then instantiates a logistic regression model using LogisticRegression() from sklearn.linear_model. Logistic regression is specifically designed for binary classification tasks.
Model Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the features (X_train) and target (y_train) using .fit() method. Finally, it makes predictions on the test set (X_test) and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
